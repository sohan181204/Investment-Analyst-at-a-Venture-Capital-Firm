      "text": "2 | Letter to the stakeholder\nDear Stakeholder,\nI am extremely proud and at the same time \nhumbled to write to you for the first time as the \nCEO of Infosys. As someone who grew up in the \nworld of technology and IT, I have tremendous \nrespect for what Infosys’ founders have built. \nMr. Murthy and his co-founders opened an entirely \nnew industry and with that, an opportunity for \nbusinesses to operate in entirely new ways and \nto bring new value by leveraging IT services. \nThey also opened an unprecedented opportunity \nfor people to pursue new career paths and \nnew beginnings inside and outside their native \ncountries. Infosys helped to not only make the \nworld flat but articulated this in a way that opened \nimaginations worldwide. The Infosys founders \nwere true entrepreneurs, but the unique things \nthey brought to the company put Infosys in a \ndifferent league – a sense of responsibility and \nquality in serving clients, an unparalleled integrity \nand transparency in operations, and a culture and \na deeply held passion for education and training, \nscaling mountaintops only a rare few companies \nachieve in their entire history.\nWhen we look at Infosys today, we can see that \nit has been a year of great transition for the \ncompany. Our full-year performance was average. \nThere were hard-fought battles in a difficult \nclimate, one in which clients’ expectations are \nchanging, new emerging technologies are rapidly \ncoming to market and where the landscape of \nservices companies has become vastly more \ncompetitive. We also faced our own internal issues \nleading to lagging growth while high attrition \nrates and the departures of many key executives \nput tremendous pressure on our business and on \nperformance. We were learning to work in a new \nenvironment and in new ways, and it has been \na difficult learning experience. But, with learning \ncomes the promise of renewing ourselves and the \nopportunity to pursue entirely new horizons.\nAs I look over the last year, I already see many \npromising signs for the future. For the year ended \nMarch 31, 2015, consolidated revenues were \n` 53,319 crore, which is a year-on-year growth of \n6.4%. In U.S. dollar terms, consolidated revenues \nwere US $8,711 million, which is a year-on-year \ngrowth of 5.6%. We saw significant cross-currency \nmovements during the year, and our revenues \ngrew by 7.1% in constant currency.\nOur focus on operational improvements led to an \nincrease in offshore effort mix from 69.4% in fiscal \n2014 to 71.2% in fiscal 2015. Additionally, utilization \n(excluding trainees) improved from 76.4% in fiscal \n2014 to 80.9% in fiscal 2015. These measures \nled to a significant improvement in operating \nmargins to 25.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 24.0% \nin fiscal 2014. This improvement was despite \nLetter to the stakeholder\nDr. Vishal Sikka\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director\nWhen we look at Infosys \ntoday, we can see that it has \nbeen a year of great transition \nfor the company",
