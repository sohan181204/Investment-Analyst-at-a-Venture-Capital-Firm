Infosys BPO s.r.o  \n \nYour Company incorporated Infosys BPO s.r.o. in the year 2004 in the Czech Republic, as a wholly owned subsidiary. \nYour company till March 31, 2012, has invested an amount of ` 3.50 Crore (18,750,000 Czech Koruna) towards its equity \ncapital. The company provides multi-lingual processing skills to its clients and addresses their requirement for a \ndevelopment center closer to their locations. During the year under review, Infosys BPO s.r.o had 12 Clients and \ngenerated revenue of ` 57.26 Crore as against revenue of ` 55.86 Crore for the year ended March 31, 2011 with a net \nloss of ` 0.34 Crore as against a profit of ` 1.54 Crore for the year ended March 31, 2011.  \nThe financial year for the Centre has been very dynamic. It saw the ramp down of 2 big projects but at the same time \nanother project was started. The attrition has been higher in Financial Year 2011-12 than usual, which helped to reduce \nthe cost related to headcount reductions in ramping down engagements. The attrition did not influence delivery which \nwas on very high level bringing high CSAT scores. Because of the new project the Centre had to invest additional amount \ninto infrastructure and recruitment. Thanks to the very good operational management the new project is growing and \nwill stay the main growth engine also for the next year.  \nB. Infosys BPO (Poland) Sp.Z.o.o \nDuring the year under review, Infosys BPO (Poland) Sp.Z.o.o has generated revenue of ` 191.67 Crore as against \nrevenue of ` 140.03 Crore for the period ended March 31, 2011 with a net profit of ` 41.71 Crore as against a profit of ` \n11.44 Crore for the period ended March 31, 2011. \n \nThe centre maintained and optimized a growth realized in 2011 for current clients by focusing on high-end services (Tax, \nSOX Compliance, FP&A reporting and analysis, FP&A Consolidation of financial statements, BTS, onsite project work) \nmoreover center started few projects for existing clients and new one. \n \nThe center has been bestowed with the following awards in the year under review: Best Outsourcing Partner \n(Outsourcing Magazine, 2011), Best Company of the Lodz Region (Bcc, 2011), Partner Of Innovative Education \n(University Of Lodz, 2011), Most Dynamically Developing Company (Puls Biznesu, 2011), Top 100 Ideal Employer \n(Universum, 2011) And Top Employer (Crf Institute, 2012).  \n \n \nC.

McCamish’s clients include many of the largest financial services companies in the United States and a growing \nnumber outside of the United States, hire McCamish to support single products, a single line of business or the client's \nentire product portfolio.  While McCamish deploys a unique instance of its base software product for each client, each \nclient also requires and funds client specific enhancements based on their proprietary product and market \nrequirements. These revenues, which are generated under time and materials or fixed priced engagements, augment \nthe recurring revenue flows from the long term master service contracts.  McCamish’s intellectual property utilizes an \nadvanced service oriented architecture that promotes seamless integration with client specific operating models.   \n \nMcCamish has been historically focused on the US market, but it is currently expanding into international markets.  \nInfosys BPO acquired the Company in December 2009 to enhance its life insurance and retirement services footprint \nboth in the US and abroad.
