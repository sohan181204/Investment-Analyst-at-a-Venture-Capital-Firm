Our sustainability \nstrategy strives to make :\n•\tOur business sustainable\n•\tOur clients’ businesses sustainable\n•\tOur ecosystem sustainable\nInfosys continues to work on large-scale digital transformation projects that significantly impact the socio-economic \nprogress of the country. Here is a brief account of three noteworthy projects in this regard.\nSmall loan transformation in a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) : Infosys is enabling a leading Indian \nNBFC to digitally transform its lending management system for various lines of business (LoBs) – such as home loans, \ntwo-wheeler loans, microfinance, and farm loans – to improve customer experience, operation and efficiency, and also \naccelerate the time-to-market of their financial products. The NBFC extends small loans to low-income individuals with \nthe objective of making them self-reliant. The microloans product is one of the highest revenue-generating businesses \nfor the NBFC and it enables rural women to obtain loans for their small-scale trade. The digital lending landscape of the \nclient was transformed by leveraging the fintech ecosystem that significantly reduces the time to sanction and disburse \nloans. Infosys’ work with the NBFC is a step in aiding India’s progress towards financial inclusion.\nEducating every girl child with Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSA) : SSA is a Government of India-backed savings scheme \nwhich was launched in January 2015. It is a girl child prosperity account targeted at the parents of girl children. This \nscheme encourages and helps parents in building a fund which can be used in future for a girl child’s education and \nmarriage expenses. As on March 31, 2019, approximately 1.3 crore SSA accounts have been opened by the Department \nof Posts, thanks to the technology solution developed by Infosys.\nProcess optimization and transparency via MCA Project : The MCA is responsible for administering the Companies Act \nto regulate the corporate sector of India. The MCA21 system provides online services for company registration and \nother regulatory filings. Infosys has partnered with the ministry to enable the processes that are critical to dispense with \nred tape, simplify paperwork, reduce individual discretion, promote uniformity, increase transparency, and in general, \nease the process of launching and doing business in India. Notably, India’s ranking on the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing \nBusiness’ index has subsequently improved. Infosys and the MCA have been continuously improving the systems \nand processes to provide greater ease to the stakeholders. The redesign of the procedures and workflows relating to a \ncompany’s incorporation has ensured that the time taken to incorporate a company has reduced from seven days on an \naverage to less than a day.",

Over 598 million accounts have been migrated to the system till date. 975 ATMs have also been enabled \nto service India Post customers. 25,448 post offices have been enabled to provide insurance policies, and 29 million \npolicies have been migrated to the new system. \nThe eBiz portal developed by Infosys is one of the 31 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) under the National eGovernance \nPlan (NeGP) of the Government of India.

Currently, the portal hosts over 50 services, including 22 central services \nand 30 state services.\nThe Government of India’s impetus on digital payments propelled many organizations towards providing enabling \nsystems and platforms.

      "text": "Infosys Annual Report 2014-15\nasset – our people. There is a feeling among our \nclients that we have elevated the conversation \nsignificantly to something much more strategic. \nThe strategy of renew and new is taking hold and \nmaking its way tangibly to our clients.\nThe strength of our organization, our brand and \nour business was reflected in numerous awards \nand recognitions that we won during the year in \naspects as diverse as business and management, \ntechnology innovation, diversity, sustainability, and \nservice offerings. While each one of them is special, \nwe are especially proud of the awards we have \nwon for Corporate Governance, and our Diversity \nand Sustainability initiatives, since these reflect our \nethos and define who we are. Our Sustainability \nReport provides detailed information on our \nresponsible business practices across parameters \nin accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's \nG4 framework.\nGoing forward, I see tremendous potential for us to \ngrow and lead. However, it will take us time to see \nthe results of the changes we have made, and are \ncontinuing to make, within and outside. It will take \nus time to renew and re‑imagine how we work, \nfrom sales to client services to delivery to finance \nand legal.\nI believe we have a promising year ahead of us in \nthe near term. Our year-on-year guidance for fiscal \n2016 is for growth to be in the range of 10‑12% in \nconstant currency. Looking beyond this year, the \nmission of our management team is to prepare the \ncompany to achieve an aspirational goal of US $20 \nbillion in revenue by calendar 2020 with at least \n30% operating margin, with specific targets of:\n•\t Increasing revenue per FTE to US $80,000 by \ndeploying automation and innovation in existing \nbusinesses, with a goal of generating at least \n30% productivity improvements in existing \nservice lines from these solutions and thereby \nmaking us more competitive to win large deals. \n•\t New platforms and our Edge portfolio working \non different revenue models will contribute \ndisproportionately to our revenue per person. \n•\t New services such as Design Thinking, solutions \nin artificial intelligence and intellectual \nproperty‑led businesses to contribute at least \n10% of revenues.\n4 | Letter to the stakeholder\nsystems – specific complex business problems \nsuch as airplane engine balancing through artificial \nneural networks, or incident ticket classification \nthrough a mix of unsupervised topic models and \nsupervised learnings. I believe we are far ahead of \nothers in this space. There are many more things \nwe will do in the new aspect of our strategy, for \nourselves and with our clients, and this will begin \nto contribute significantly to our overall revenue \nthrough new revenue models and by enabling us \nto be much more proactive in growing our existing \nclient relationships in more meaningful ways.\nWe are also increasing the depth of what we \ncan do ourselves with strategic acquisitions \nand investments. We acquired Panaya, which is \nenabling us to bring higher-margin solutions to \nour clients in the area of automation; we are also \nacquiring Skava, which will enable us to bring \nentirely new digital retail shopping experiences \nto our large retail clients. We have made some \nkey investments which I believe will help us look \nto entirely new areas, for example through our \ninvestment in Nova, a venture between Infosys \nand DreamWorks Animation, a leader in animation \ntechnology and animation films. Nova will \ndevelop and commercialize image-generation \ntechnology in order to provide end-to-end \ndigital manufacturing capabilities for companies \ninvolved in the design, manufacturing, marketing \nor distribution of physical consumer products. \nWe are also investing in Airviz in the internet of \nthings area.\nAcross all these areas of renew and new, we are \nsharply differentiating our existing services to be \nmore competitive in the marketplace. We have also \nbegun to create new revenue models and new \nconsumption models that bring more value to \nour clients and ultimately will bring more value to \nshareholders through high-growth areas such as \nnew services and business models, new platforms \nand new unique skills among our most important \nGoing forward, I see \ntremendous potential for \nus to grow and lead",
